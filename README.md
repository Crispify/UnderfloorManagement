# UnderfloorManagement

The NetBeans Java project combines information from the Atag One and from VBus.net to decide whether to switch an underfloor heating pump appliance on or off via a Raspberry Pi connected to a relais board. 

Main software components:
- Atag One connection and status reader (Thanks to https://github.com/kozmoz/atag-one-api)
- Vbus.net api status reader
- Raspberry Pi GPIO pin switch
